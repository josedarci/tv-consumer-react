# tv-consumer-react
We would like to see a small web app with two pages (routes): a details page for the TV show "Powerpuff Girls",
and an episode detail page with information about specific episodes.

Page 1:
The TV show page should at least display the following information (you're free to add more):
• Show title
• Show Description
• Show cover image
• Episode list. Every episode in the list should link to a details page for that specific episode

Page 2:
The episode detail page should contain at least:
• Episode-title
• Episode Summary
• Episode cover image

API: http://www.tvmaze.com/api

Requirements:
• Use React to render UI components.
• Use "Create React App" to bootstrap your project.
• Setup two routes in your app, one for TV shows and one for episodes.
• Retrieve data from TV Maze REST API
• Setup state management - redux - and data flow
• Style your components with CSS, make sure that the end result is responsive and has at least one breakpoint.
• All code should be checked-in into a Git repository
• Documentation is optional but appreciated, the same goes for comments in your code
Any doubt just ask.
